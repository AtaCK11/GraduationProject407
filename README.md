# GraduationProject407

This repository hosts the complete source code and configuration for a multi-component healthcare monitoring system. It includes:

- AP (Access Point)

- Bedside Monitor App

- Patient Monitoring Device

- Website

- Test Components

- ATAOS_WATCH (as a submodule)

I have used ESP32 (with FreeRTOS) while i developed the project. Other parts of the code can be ported to an Arduino but AP is written using ESP-IDF.

The project also includes the custom PCB (hopefully the latest revisions), if you dislike using a breadboard (because my connections was  loose all the time).
